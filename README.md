#dotfiles

dotfiles folder, contains bashrc, tmux, tmux configuration, vim configuration, scripts.

to deploy: 
    bash deploy.sh

notes: some tools might need to be manually installed (cf apps2install).
At term I hope to have this installation done in the deploy script. 


MacVim notes.

Once MacVim installed and deploy script is run, launch a MacVIm instance and run:
NoeBundleInstall to download the vim plugins.
